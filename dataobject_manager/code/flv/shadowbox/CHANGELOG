Shadowbox.js Changelog

version 3.0

- A major rewrite/reorganization of the code
- Greatly simplified setup process by eliminating all load* methods and using
  options to specify language/adapter/player(s) instead

  simplify skin customization
- Made public many methods and properties that had previously been private and
  eliminated redundant accessor methods (such as getVersion, getPlugins, etc.)

  support for express install
- Added flashVersion, flashVars, and flashParams options for passing options
  directly to swfobject
