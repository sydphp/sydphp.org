A Shadowbox "adapter" is a small helper file that makes it easy to use
Shadowbox with a given JavaScript framework. Since most JavaScript frameworks
tend to contain a basic set of very similar functions (for retrieving style
information on elements or handling events, for example) it is not necessary to
tie Shadowbox to a particular framework. Instead, the adapter can use the
underlying framework that is already loaded on the page to reuse some of the
code.

If you do not see an adapter for your favorite framework in this directory, feel
free to create your own and implement the same interface as the others. It may
then be used the same as you would use any other.
