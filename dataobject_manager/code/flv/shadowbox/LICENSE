Shadowbox.js License version 1.0

This license is applicable to version 3.0 of the code and greater until superseded
by a later version.

Shadowbox.js is available for use under the terms of two separate, yet similar
licenses. The first of these may be exercised by individuals and organizations
who employ the software for non-commercial uses. This license grants the licensee
the following privileges:

  - Use

    The software, including code, images, and documentation may be used in a web
    site or application that is not used for commercial purposes.

  - Modification

    The software, including code, images, and documentation may be modified by the
    user to suit his purpose.

The second type of license may be obtained for a fee from the copyright holder and
removes the non-commercial restriction from the terms of use. This commercial
license may be obtained for one developer or multiple developers in the same
organization or company.

Under neither license is the licensee permitted to redistribute the source code,
images, or documentation contained in this project. All redistribution rights
remain with the copyright holder unless specific prior written permission is
obtained.

Under no circumstance shall this copyright notice or list of conditions be
modified or removed from the code distribution in either source or binary form.

This software is provided by the copyright holder and contributors "as is" and
any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed.

In no event shall the copyright holder or contributors be liable for any direct,
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but
not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or
profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability,
whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise)
arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the
possibility of such damage.
