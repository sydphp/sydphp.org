Shadowbox is an online media viewing application that supports all of the web's
most popular media publishing formats. Shadowbox is written entirely in
JavaScript and CSS and is highly customizable. Using Shadowbox, website authors
can display a wide assortment of media in all major browsers without navigating
users away from the linking page.

You should have received a license with this distribution explaining the terms
under which Shadowbox may be used. If you did not, you may obtain a copy of the
